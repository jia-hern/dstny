## Introduction
SEI 23 - Project 3
Database is hosted here: dstny.herokuapp.com/

#### App Objectives
- Decide-for-me app, user post a question, other users can vote yes/no and/or add comments for that particular post 
- Users (OP) can post a question - e.g. chicken rice or fish soup?
- Other users (voters) can vote on decisions available
- Users may also be able to follow one another (following can serve as a filter)

#### Project Objectives
**Technical Requirements**
- Use Ruby on Rails and Active Record to build an application
- Create an application using at least 2 related models and an additional user model with authentication
- Include all major CRUD functions for at least one of those models
- Craft thoughtful user stories together, as a team
- Manage team contributions and collaboration using a standard Git flow on Github
- Layout and style your front-end with clean & well-formatted CSS, with or without a framework.
- Deploy your application online so it's publically accessible

**Required Deliverables**
-  working app, built by the whole team, hosted somewhere on the internet
-  A link to your hosted working app in the URL section of your Github repo
-  A team git repository hosted on Github, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits from every team member dating back to the very beginning of the project.
-  A readme.md file with:
   -  Explanations of the technologies used
   -  A couple paragraphs about the general approach you took
   -  Installation instructions for any dependencies
   -  Link to your user stories – who are your users, what do they want, and why?
   -  Link to your wireframes – sketches of major views / interfaces in your application
   -  Descriptions of any unsolved problems or major hurdles your team had to overcome
   - A presentation.md of "slides" that walk through a demo of your app.
